## Overview

**LockIn** is a client-side password security tool that helps users:
- Evaluate the strength of existing passwords in real-time
- Generate cryptographically secure random passwords
- Understand password security best practices

### Why LockIn?

| Problem | LockIn Solution |
|---------|-----------------|
| Weak passwords are the #1 cause of breaches | Real-time strength feedback with clear requirements |

## Usage

### Checking Password Strength

2. Select desired character types:
   - ✅ Uppercase (A-Z)
   - ✅ Lowercase (a-z)
   - ✅ Numbers (0-9)
   - ✅ Special characters
3. Adjust length using the slider (8-32)

## Technical Architecture

### Design Philosophy
LockIn follows a **CSS-first approach** where visual states are controlled by CSS using `data-*` attributes, minimizing JavaScript to only essential functionality.

### JavaScript Responsibilities (40 lines)
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Password evaluation | Calculates strength, sets data attributes |
| Password generation | Creates random strings using `Math.random()` |
| Clipboard API | Copies generated password |
| DOM updates | Slider value, visibility toggle |

### CSS Responsibilities
| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Strength meter colors | `[data-strength="weak/fair/strong"]` selectors |
| Requirement checkmarks | `[data-has-upper="true"]` selectors |
| Hover/focus states | Native CSS pseudo-classes |
| Responsive layout | CSS media queries |

### Security Considerations
- ✅ **No data transmission** - everything runs client-side
- ✅ **No storage** - passwords are never saved
- ✅ **No tracking** - no analytics or cookies
- ⚠️ For production use, consider `crypto.getRandomValues()` for cryptographic randomness
